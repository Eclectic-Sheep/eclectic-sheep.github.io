# Introducing Fabric RL
We are proud to announce the release of Fabric RL, the best RL framework ever written.

Fabric RL is an Open Source framework for fast prototyping and benchmarking of Reinforcement Learning algorithms. It is built on top of PyTorch and is designed to be easy to read, hack, extend and use.

Powered by Lightning Fabric, it is also very easy to distribute and scale on multiple GPUs and machines.

You can find the code on [GitHub](). Follow the readme to install it and start using it.

It will be so easy that you will be able to train your first agent in less than 5 minutes.
