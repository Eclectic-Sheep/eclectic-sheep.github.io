# About Us

Welcome to SheepRL, where we shepherd the future of reinforcement learning.

At SheepRL, we're a group of driven experts, passionate about the world of reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is simple but ambitious: to push RL boundaries and create smart agents that can change our lives. We see the huge potential RL holds and are committed to bringing its power from simulated settings to the challenges of real-world scenarios.

We're not just enthusiasts—we're specialists in developing RL algorithms that are ready for real-world use. With our roots in the gaming industry, we've gained unique insights into how RL algorithms can be applied. Games, with their complex, ever-changing landscapes, have been an ideal training ground for our algorithms. This experience has equipped us with the skills to craft RL algorithms that can handle complexity and change—vital capabilities in any industry. We're hands-on pioneers, ready to tackle the challenges of using RL across various fields.

We also believe in the power of collaboration. We invite anyone—researcher, business, or innovator—who shares our excitement for RL to join us on this exciting journey. Our collaborations go beyond making products. We're eager to discover new RL applications, solve critical problems, and change the way we use technology. We're envisioning a future where artificial intelligence is more than a tool—it's a partner that helps us reach new heights. We think your contribution could be the spark for the next big RL breakthrough. So, let's work together to use RL to create innovative solutions and a more efficient, adaptable, and smart world. We're excited to explore these possibilities with you.
